This directory NeoHookean_Newton_CompressedStrip_DispFromUniform contains a nonlinear finite
element calculation of a 2-D strip of a NeoHookean material in compression.

It uses an energy function of the following form:

  W(I, II) = mu*[0.5*(I - 2 - log(II)) + (nu/(1-nu))*(sqrt(II) - 1)^2]

  where I and II are the trance and determinant of the cauchy green tensor, respectfully.
  mu and nu are material parameters.

Calling format:

  printf "input_file_name" | ./NeoHookean_Newton_CompressedStrip

Input file format: (an example input file is included in exampleInputFile.txt)
  - blank lines and ones starting with a '#' are ignored

  - First line is the grid dimensions in the x1 and x2 direction, respectfully. This controls how
    fine the mesh is.

  - Next line is the domain dimensions in the x1 and x2 direction, respectfully. This controls
    the size of the strip.

  - Next line is the final loading value (between zero and 1) and the number of load steps to
    get to the final value.

  - Next line is the number of steps between outputs.

  - final line is absolute tolerance on the l2 norm of the residual for the newton iteration.

Outputs:

  - "load_info.txt"                      : This is a text file which is outputted at the end of the program.
                                           it has data for the loading steps, energy values, and congugate
                                           lambda values. The first column is the loading value, second is
                                           the system energy, and final column is the congugate lambda value

  Output frequency of the following are dictated by the value on the 4th input line of the input file

  - "displacement_from_uniform-*.vtk"    : This is a vtk file that has the refence mesh, and the values of the
                                           solution vector of the FEM, which is the displacements from the
                                           uniform compression of isotropic strip with mu = 1 and nu = 0.33.

  - "total_displacement-*.vtk"           : This is a vtk file that has the refence mesh and the values of the
                                           total displacement of the nodes (this is the solution vector plus the
                                           uniform compression displacements).

  - "deformed_mesh-*.vtk"                : This is a vtk file with the DEFORMED MESH and the vales of the
                                           total displacement of the nodes (this is the solution vector plus the
                                           uniform compression displacements).

With the input file you can change the details of the mesh, domain, and loading. This can be done without having to recompile the code.
But to change the functions for the mu and nu values, you will have to go into the code and change them maunually. These can be found
the MuFunctionn::value() and NuFunctionn::value() functions on lines 222 and 247, respectfully.
